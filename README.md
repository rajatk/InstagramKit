This is a fork of [shyambhat/InstagramKit](https://github.com/shyambhat/InstagramKit) where I added infinite scrolling and pull to refresh features to the feed.

Instagram recently added infinite scrolling to their explore tab. It would be great if they added pull to refresh as well. 

Credits: [SVPullToRefresh](https://github.com/samvermette/SVPullToRefresh), one of my favorite UIScrollView categories. 

==================

##Installation

Make sure to run 'pod install' and add your Instagram App Client ID in the .plist file before you test this.
